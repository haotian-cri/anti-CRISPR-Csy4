1. genomic_screening.mlx: a live script to perform screening on the whole transcriptome to design all possible pre-crRNA sensors

2. pRDCrX_mdl_4114_100.mat: the model used in this script. A random forest model, using raw sequences as the predictor with 100 trees.
Note: this model can be replaced by other models, such as random forest model using raw sequences as the predictor,
1D CNN model, or Seq2DFunc model, as desired.

3. A00_Window_Sliding.m: the supporting function to perform window sliding

4. E_coli_K12_screening.mat: the output result
