# Automated design pipeline of pre-crRNAs and acrRNAs pairs
For a given RNA sequence as the “seed”, we created a list of all its fragments in an 18-nt window. Then the 18-nt sequences were splitted into two 9-nt pieces to flank CBS. The sequence of flanked CBS (33-nt in total) to construct potential pre-crRNA switches was then evaluated by a valuation model (e.g. Seq2DFunc). Those sequences predicted not to be a processable were excluded. For each remaining pre-crRNA, we designed a cognate acrRNA trigger, which consists of a 5’ stem loop, an 18-nt interaction domain containing anti-flanking sequences, and strong terminator ECK12003373738, using Nupack 3.1.0 complexdesign function37. We also removed the pre-crRNAs from the list if cognate acrRNAs cannot be designed by Nupack.
