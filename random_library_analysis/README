# Random library analysis

This folder includes the necessary Matlab scripts to read fasta files of NGS data, transform into matlab-compatible structure, clean the data (exclude wrong reads
and outliers), perform feature analysis (including sequence and structure analysis), and build random forest models.

Two sub-folders are included. Small-dataset: a small dataset and the analysis script, which can be used for demo; Large-dataset: a larger dataset and the analysis
script, which requires about a week to perform the full analysis. The analysis script in two folders are the same with a few modifications.
