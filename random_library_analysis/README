# Random library analysis

This folder includes:

1. Raw count data of NGS results of pre-crRNA libraries with random flanking sequences.

2. A live script to perform the data analysis using raw count data as the input. The data analysis includes:

a. read the files of NGS raw data into matlab data structure;
b. clean the data: exclude the wrong reads and outliers;
c. feature analysis: sequence and structure analysis;
d. build a simple random forest modle for classification using raw sequences as predictors;

3. Processed files saved in ".mat" format

4. examples of random forest model

5. Scripts of necessary function

Two sub-folders are included.

small_dataset: a small dataset and the analysis script, which can be used for demo;

large_dataset: a larger dataset and the analysis script, which requires about a week to perform the full analysis.

The analysis script in two folders are the same with a few modifications.
